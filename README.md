Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was the goal to create a web application that allowed customers to book appointments with drivers in order to practice their driving skills and eventually learn enough to pass their driving exam. The client for this DriverPass application was the owner, Liam and his IT officer Ian. The system they were looking for was a web application that would be supported with a server and security as well as have features to ensure the Administrator would be alerted if anything went wrong. This system would allow account creation for users as well as allow appointments made within the interface. Lastly there would be an option for feedback to ensure that customers could communicate their experience and drivers could see what they are doing well and what they should improve on. 

What did you do particularly well?

I think that what i did really well was the diagrams that i made for the second project. I didn't really like my use case diagram that i submitted for my discussion post so i redid the entire diagram for my project and then i used that as the basis for the rest of my diagrams which i think made it so much easier but it also made me determined to also make those really good diagrams so overall that is what i think i did the best at and what i am most proud of in the project.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the business document. I feel that was my weakest overall when it comes to the two projects. I think i would really sit down and try to bullet point list all the things i would want from DriverPass and use that as a rough guide for all of my points as i feel not all my points were super focused on what i was looking for in DriverPass. It wasn't a bad document overall but i think it was my weakest of the two projects.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the users needs by making sure they are able to understand and use the application in a way that is easy for them. For those that aren't as able to use the website they do have the option to call the secretary to book their appointment but, for those that can i wanted to ensure the GUI was uniform and the layout of the web application was logical and clear to whoever uses it.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I always try to create a rough document of ideas that i am looking for when it comes to the program. I try to then refine it into the main ideas that i am wanting the program to achieve. After that i may start making some rough program iterations of some of the ideas and i do code with OOP in mind so any program bits i think are good i can easily incorporate into the code that i am writing. From there it is just refining and refining until i feel i have a finished product.
